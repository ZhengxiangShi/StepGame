## Description
Here are the dataset and codes for the AAAI 2022 paper "[**StepGame: A New Benchmark for Robust Multi-Hop Spatial Reasoning in Texts**](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21383)".

## Our Contributions
* A new benchmark for multi-hop spatial reasoning in texts.
* A memory augmented neural network for multi-hop spatial reasoning.

## StepGame Dataset
### Version
We offer two variations of our StepGame dataset, both of which are identical in content except for the size of samples.
- `TrainVersion`: The "TrainVersion" is utilised in the baseline models presented in our paper. The models are trained on clean samples with varying levels of noise (k=1,2,3,4,5), where each value of k has 10,000 and 1,000 samples for training and validation, respectively. Thus, the total number of training samples is 50,000. During the testing phase, noise samples with k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 are used. All of these samples are consolidated in the "[TrainVersion](Dataset/TrainVersion)" folder.

- `CompleteVersion`: The "CompleteVersion" is an extension of the "TrainVersion" that we have provided to enable future research on spatial reasoning over texts. This extended version includes more samples and contains both clean and noise data. In this version, each part (clean and noise) consists of 30,000, 1,000, and 30,000 samples for training, validation, and testing, respectively, for values of k ranging from 1 to 10. All of these samples are consolidated in the "[CompleteVersion](Dataset/CompleteVersion)" folder.

### Generate more samples
You can produce additional samples by executing the following command:
```
cd Code
python parameterized_step_game_8relation.py --seed 123
```
